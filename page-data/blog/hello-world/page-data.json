Why Blog I am starting a software development blog‚Ä¶","html":"<p>Let me use my first blog post to explain why I am blogging, why now, and why I\nam hosting the blog myself.</p>\n<h2>Why Blog</h2>\n<p>I am starting a software development blog primarily to help me learn. I\nunderstand a topic far better after I have committed thoughts to writing.</p>\n<p>In the years that I have considered blogging, I anticipated using a blog to\ncollect quick, arcane how-to reminders for myself. I have kept a note with a\nlist of these how-to posts including ‚Äúhow to configure Maven to run unit tests\nin parallel‚Äù and ‚Äúhow to achieve space efficient backups for append only\nlog-based databases using hard links and rsync‚Äù. Stack Overflow is full of such\nquick, arcane how-to posts. The how-to posts I anticipated blogging would be\nmore appropriate on Stack Overflow. I may still blog about some arcane how-to\ntopics occasionally, but I have different goals for blogging now.</p>\n<p>I would like to use my blog to write long-form explanations of topics that I\nthink I have researched well. My hope is that some of these explainers can serve\nas valuable resources for myself and others.</p>\n<h2>Why Now</h2>\n<p>I made my aforementioned list of arcane how-to posts when my career required me\nto be a generalist. Such posts are helpful to generalists: they often need to\nfind an existing solution to an unfamiliar problem quickly then move onto the\nnext thing. Until recently, my career required me to be a generalist: I worked\non government programs and the nature of my work changed every 18 months.</p>\n<p>For the past several years, I specialize in Java agent development and web\napplication security at Contrast Security. I enjoy taking time to research a\ntopic and truly understand it. Blogging is a tool to encourage me to deeply\nunderstand a topic well enough that I can explain it to others in a blog post.</p>\n<h2>Why Self-Host</h2>\n<p>I blog and write <em>a lot</em> at work, but my first foray into blogging for fun was\nas an\n<a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/author/johnathan-gilday/\">author on baeldung.com</a>. I\nlike the idea of writing for an existing blog, because it takes away the\ndistractions of building the blog itself so I can focus on the content. I wrote\na few Java related articles for Baeldung, but it ultimately wasn‚Äôt for me.\nBaeldung is a business and has different goals for blogging: they are trying to\noptimize SEO and a high-rate of new content, and I am trying to optimize my\nlearning and happiness.</p>\n<p>Baeldung was not a good fit for me now, but it taught me that I need to try\nwriting on my own blog. Hosting my own blog means I will not get the same amount\nof visitors as I would writing on a platform like medium.com. However, I have\ncomplete control over my content. It also means I have to do a lot more work to\nbuild the features I need to get started, but that‚Äôs part of the fun üòÄ.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"üéâ Hello World!","date":"August 20, 2020","description":"Let me use my first blog post to explain why I am blogging, why now, and why I am hosting the blog myself."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/macos-homebrew-openjdk/","sourceName":"blog"},"frontmatter":{"title":"üçé Installing and Managing Java on macOS"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","614056702"],"slicesMap":{}}
